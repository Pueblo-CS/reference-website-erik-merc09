        <p class="info"> American Football originated in the United States by a man called Walter Camp, who was both a player
            and coach by making the specific rules that are imbedded into football today. The first ever American 
            Football match to be played was November 6, 1869 between two colleges which were Rutgers and Princeton 
            and took place in in New Brunswick, New Jersey with about 100 people watching which ended in Rutgers 
            winning 6-4. After around 50 years later the NFL association is created on September 17, 1920 in Canton, 
            Ohio with 10 original football teams and 4 joining later on that year. After around 50 years pass the 
            first ever American Football superbowl is played on January 15, 1967 by the Green Bay Packers and the 
            Kansas City Chiefs which was the defeat of the Chiefs 35-10. As of today, there has been 59 total 
            superbowls that have been played and around 32 NFL teams that have been created since the start which has been a around 60 years of football being made.</p>
